# About Adobe Experience Manager Guides {#id1645E0A50MY}

Adobe Experience Manager Guides is a powerful, enterprise-grade component content management solution \(CCMS\). It comes in two flavors - on-prem and cloud service. It enables native DITA support in Adobe Experience Manager, empowering AEM to handle DITA-based content creation and delivery. It empowers authors to create content using an easy-to-use built-in web editor.

Experience Manager Guides provides all core CCMS functions, such as authoring, collaboration, review, translation, search, reports, and metadata management for DITA content, enabling authors to do more in less time through efficient content reuse and powerful workflows.
